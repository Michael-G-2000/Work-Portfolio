== Project Description ==

This project was the second part of an assignment for the Designing Web Applications using XML unit.  For this project we had to create a car rental management website that used XML to store the data of the carss available for rental, customer details and past and current rental bookings.

This website had to allow a user to add and edit rental bookings and customers as well as implement proper user login/logout functionalities.

HTML and CSS was used to display and format the content of the webpages.
PHP was used as the server side language.
XML was used to store the information needed by the website.
