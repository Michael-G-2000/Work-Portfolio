== Project Description ==

This was the second project for the Data Structures and Algorithms unit.

Using C++ I created a program that compiled a word frequency AVL tree using 5 news articles contained in text files. Once a frequency tree was created it could be searched
to view information on each word stored in the tree. When a searching the tree the 5 closetest matches to the inputed phrase are displayed for the user.

The file AVL_ADT.h was provided to the class for this project and is not my own work.  This was because the project was centred around being able to use an AVL Tree not 
whether you could create one.
