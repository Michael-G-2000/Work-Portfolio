File Name: Ethical Hacking Project Report

File Name: Network Security Project Report

Description: This was the final assignment for the Network Security unit.  Using two Windows XP virtual machines I was given tasks to scan ports, detect what services were being used by open ports, detect what OS the target computer was using and analyse the packet traffic during the previous tasks.  For this assignment I used Zenmap which is a GUI for nmap and wireshark to capture packet traffic so that it could be analysed.
