== Project Description ==

This project was a part of my Design and Technology subject for the Higher School Certificate.

This was a year long project where the goal was to design a product that solved a need in society.

For this subject, I decided to create a mobile app that alerted users to nearby emergency vehicles.

This project was coded in Swift using Xcode.  Due to the fact that this was my first time atempting
programming, my teacher put me in contact with a Software Engineer at Apple who helped me during the process. 

Because this app still has potential to be taken further I will not be sharing my code at this time.

This project won me the Bendigo Inventor's 2017, Inventor of the Year Award.
