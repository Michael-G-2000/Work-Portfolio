== Project Description ==

This project was an assessment for the Data Structures and Algorithms unit.  This project involved recreating an existing Cephalopod game along with A.I. players using Java.

The project had to allow a person to play Cephalopod against another human or an A.I. player.  This A.I. player had multiple difficulties created using different 
algorithms ranging from an A.I. that made random moves to an A.I. that used the Monte Carlo algorithm.

The Monte Carlo algorithm was provided to the class by the lecturer and was adapted to make the SmartPlayer A.I.

This project was all done in Java.
