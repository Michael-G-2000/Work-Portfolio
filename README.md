File Name: Ethical Hacking Project Report

Description: This was the final assignment for the Ethical Hacking Principles unit.  Using a Kali Linux, Metasploitable  and Windows XP virtual machine I was given tasks centred around identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities on a target computer.  For this assignment I used OpenVAS to scan for vulnerabilites, metasploitable to exploit the vulnerabilites abd nmap for file transfer.  The last part of the assignment was to complete activites on the picoCTF website.  picoCTF is a cybersecurity challenge where you use various cybersecuirty exploits in order to find a hidden phrase.

File Name: Network Security Project Report

Description: This was the final assignment for the Network Security unit.  Using two Windows XP virtual machines I was given tasks to scan ports, detect what services were being used by open ports, detect what OS the target computer was using and analyse the packet traffic during the previous tasks.  For this assignment I used Zenmap which is a GUI for nmap and wireshark to capture packet traffic so that it could be analysed.
